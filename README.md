# Detoxify 4chan posts

## What is this?

While still enjoying the occasional lurk on 4chan, over the years I've found that the people visiting these boards nowadays are more akin to a pack of jabbering primates than members of something bigger.

Many of the boards now appear as though stuck in a loop, frozen in time; Echoing the same toxicity without adding any value. 

So I wrote a script that'll expunge the boards of posts matching the **words** array in the script. a User Script has been attached for those who wish to use TamperMonkey, GreaseMonkey, or other derivatives. 

## Installation

Grab the contents of the User Script, and paste it into a new User Script in your preferred User Script browser extension, or import the **.js** file.

## Usage

1. Once added to your User Script manager, you're done.
2. Refresh the page to see posts hidden the match the word list.

## Notes
You can add or remove words to the list without breaking the script, as long as you enter them in the comma-separated format the existing words are already in.
